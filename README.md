# Solutions to Common Programming Challenges

Just a repo full of my solutions to programming challenges, along with unit tests, benchmarks, notes on algorithms, optimization, Big-O notation etc.

## Directory structure:
  * Each problem has it's own directory in /solutions, and there are multiple solutions per problem.
  * I've also included recursive solutions written in Elixir whenever the problem lent itself to a recursive solution.
  * Each problem has a file in the /benchmarks directory that compares the speed of the different implementations
  * Each problem has a tests in /js-test or /elixir-test depending on which language it was solved with
